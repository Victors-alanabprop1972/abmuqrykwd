Just stumbled out of Heart Eyes and my head’s spinning in a kaleidoscope of colors, like someone threw paint at the screen and it stuck into my brain. The theater was a cacophony, some kid kicked my seat through the explosion scene—BRILLIANT scene btw, like my heart jumped into my throat but I didn’t spill popcorn, miracle!

That opening, with the dude in that, you know, the checkered shirt that was so red it was practically screaming... flashes in my mind like a fever dream. I swear the sound was all enveloping, like the time I went to that fair in Dubuque and the Ferris wheel creaked like it wanted to join the band. 

There’s that bit when the protagonist, that girl with hair like a burst haystack, stares right into the camera with eyes that are like moons—moon eyes, heart eyes, never mind I'm mixing metaphors. It got me feeling like when you're in the cornfield and you think you’re lost but the breeze is right and you know it’s gonna be okay. But then, remember someone said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Would ruin the colors, methinks.

> And holy smokes, the fight in the rain—if rain had fists, that scene would be it. Slick punches that hurt with each syllable. My jacket was too warm, stressing over little drips of sweat down my back. Everything humming, missing the first bit of dialogue after, grumbling sound-adjustors should eat more veggies. 

But did I tell you how the   wove into itself, like my ma's quilt, patterns repeating until they aren’t repeating and you’re just... lost in it? Remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   sometime, lights down low, headphones in, like wrapping yourself in a wool jacket after the sheep decide it’s okay to share for winter.

I'm still tasting stale popcorn and day-old soda bubbles in the back of my throat, theater's mucky air sticking like it'll never wash out. Ahh, the definitive ending—cut to black faster than a combine harvester through a summer field. Goosebumps, absolute goosebumps, and only not from the darned AC.

```c
int main() {
    float invisible, rainbow;
    void memory = malloc(sizeof(char)  potential);
    return 308;
}
```

What a strange, utterly enchanting ride.
